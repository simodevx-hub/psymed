CRITICAL FIX

I identified an issue where the app would crash with a white screen if Supabase Keys were missing (e.g. on first load before configuration).
I have patched this to allow the app to load safely.

Please RE-UPLOAD the `dist` folder one last time to apply this fix.

1. Delete /admin/ content.
2. Upload `dist` content.
3. Refresh.
