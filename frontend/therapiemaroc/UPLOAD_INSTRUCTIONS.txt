SUCCESS: Configuration Fixed & Build Complete

I installed the missing TailwindCSS dependencies and configured the styling for your `therapiemaroc` project.
I also integrated the `.env` credentials you provided.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Go to `c:\xampp\htdocs\psymaroc\frontend\therapiemaroc\dist`.
2.  Upload the contents (index.html, assets, svg) to your server's `/admin/` (or target) directory.
3.  Refresh the page.

You should now see the styled application working correctly.
