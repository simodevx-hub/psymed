FINAL FIX: Supabase Credentials Now Embedded

The Supabase credentials are now properly baked into the build.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Go to `c:\xampp\htdocs\psymaroc\frontend\therapiemaroc\dist`.
2.  **Delete** all old files from `/admin/` on your server.
3.  **Upload** the NEW files (index.html, assets folder, vite.svg).
4.  Refresh the page.

The app should now connect to your real Supabase database instead of the placeholder.
