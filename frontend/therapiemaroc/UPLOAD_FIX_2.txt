FIXED: 404 Errors on Deployment

The issue was that the app was looking for files in the root folder (`/assets/...`) instead of your subfolder (`/admin/assets/...`).
I have updated the configuration to use "Relative Paths" (`./`).

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Go to `c:\xampp\htdocs\psymaroc\frontend\therapiemaroc\dist`.
2.  **Delete** the old files from your server.
3.  **Upload** the NEW contents of `dist` (`index.html`, `vite.svg`, `assets` folder).
4.  Refresh your page.

Your 404 errors should be gone.
